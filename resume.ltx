            As part of the distributed team behind the largest Mac software
            distribution and sales platform outside of Apple, I designed and
            implemented data-driven solutions that powered MacUpdate's

                \item Worked cross-functionally in a leadership capacity and

            I worked to build and scale our community-driven platform by
            delivering battle-tested, complete user-facing solutions and
            internal tools for our own team. \\
            \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
                \item Worked with Sales \& Marketing to create updated and
                      backwards-compatible internal sales back end, greatly
                      reducing friction and resources needed to create and
                      launch sales \& promotions
                \item Conducted audit of and executed major refactor for
                      site-wide caching infrastructure, empowering our team
                      to ship better features faster
                \item Rewrote major app bundle promotion systems, enabling 
                      Sales \& Marketing to launch bundle promotions with
                      little-to-no Engineering resources and allowing for
                      automated deployment of simultaneous live promotions
                \item Conducted security audit of our websites and product,
                      fixing critical vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injections,
                      access controls)
                \item Trained other teams in use of Engineering-developed
                      internal tools, ensuring co-workers were able to use
                      in-house systems effectively
                \item Worked to execute and troubleshoot migration to cloud-
                      based AWS infrastructure
